## Security frameworks

A starting point for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

### NIS Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

Consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

Core functions:

1. Identity: Monitor systems, identify potential issues.
2. Protect: Mitigating cybersecurity threats w/ tools, policies, training, etc.
3. Detect: Detect potential incidents, improve monitoring capabilities.
4. Respond: Actually handle an incident! And implement improvements. Document what happened, prevent it happening again.
5. Recover: Bring services / assets online again.

### OWASP principles

Some examples:

- Minimise attack surface area: E.g. expose as little as possible.
- Principle of least privilege: As little access as possible.
- Defense in depth: Use multiple security controls, that use different approaches. E.g. 2FA & firewalls & permission settings.
- Separation of duties: Nobody should have ALL perms.
- Keep security simple
- Fix security issues correctly
- Establish secure defaults
- Fail securely
- Don't trust services
- Avoid security by obscurity

## Security controls

Actions to reduce a specific risk.

3 common types:

- Encryption: Encoding into ciphertext.
- Authentication: Logging in to access.
- Authorization: Only letting some users access some assets.

Additionally:

- Physical controls, e.g. fences, guards, CCTV, access badges.
- Technical controls, e.g. firewall, 2FA, antivirus
- Administrative controls, e.g. authorization

## Security audits

### Internal

Usually just internal security team (and compliance officer):

- Establishing scope and goals
- Conducting risk assessment
- Conducting controls assessment
- Assessing compliance
- Communicating results

## Feedback

Having the same "host" throughout a course helps stay "centred", even when there are guest speakers.
